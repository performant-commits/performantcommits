# ⚡️ Using Performant Commits

Performant Commits are a sleek, performant way of writing better, more efficient, and understandable commit messages. The over-arching goal of the PC design specifications for commit messages stems from the fact that they must be descriptive, fun, and professional - all at once. Not only does this allow more feasibility and ease of use, *it trasnforms entire development experiences* for both teams and individuals.</i>

In the future, we anticipate the community will come up with innovative additions to enhance what could be the simplest, most powerful and well-tested interface for productivity and collaboration in commit messages.          

The following is the standard Performant Commit message structure:

**Standard (Full)**

Used during most occasions (or at least ones in which convention is wanted to be followed to its fullest.

```
$ type[primary scope/secondary scope] => ~emoji~ Description | Stack
```

**Practical**

Used during most situations for enhanced practicality and balance between convention and rapidness.

```
$ type[scope] => ~emoji~ Description
```

**Simple (Fast)**

Used for quick commits (usually when pushing minor changes or in a rush).

```
$ type => ~emoji~ Description
```

Examples of Performant Commits in action:

```   
$ ft[core/parser] => ⚡️ Implement basic parser logic | FNTD
```

```
$ rfct[lib/searchEngine] => 📖 Destructure source objects | BCKN
```
```
$ deps[packages] => 🧪 Update to latest version of DefinitelyTyped
```
`NOTE:` Some properties are optional and are therefore missing. In addition, some present in these examples can be removed from the commit messages if needed/preferred.
